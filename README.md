# ROS-wheeled-robot-master
This is the final project of ME332 (Robot Operating System).

Since our group member uses different versions of ROS. So there are two workspace for this project: kinetic and melodic. They share the same results but have a little bit different caused by the ROS versions. See the maintainer list below:
- kinetic: Z.T. Yu, B.W. Shen, S.Q.Li
- melodic: Y.H. Sun
