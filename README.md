# ROS-wheeled-robot-master
This is the final project of ME332 (Robot Operating System).

There are two workspaces for this project (kinetic and melodic) because our group member uses different versions of ROS. They share the same results but have a little bit difference caused by the ROS versions. See the maintainer list below:
- kinetic: Z.T. Yu, B.W. Shen, S.Q. Li
- melodic: Y.H. Sun

2020.5.10 Kinetic and Melodic versions are all set up

2020.5.11 diff_drive is applicable now in gazebo
